# GCP Django Template

> Welcome to the Google Django Stanford Documentation base!

This is the second of [several templates](https://stanford-rc.github.io/rse-services/docs/resources/google-cloud) 
that takes the opinion that it shouldn't be a lot of work to deploy an application to show off your analysis, paper, or even to
create a programmatic RestFul API for others to use. Brought to you by [Research Software Engineering Services](https://stanford-rc.github.io/rse-services), this is one of several free-to-use templates that will get you started with a solid base for your development.
If you have any requests for features or questions, please don't hesitate
to [open an issue]({{ site.repo }}/issues).
