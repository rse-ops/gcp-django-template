# GCP Django Template

> Google Cloud Project Django Template

You might want to quickly deploy an application to show off your analysis, paper,
or even create a programmatic RestFul API for others to use. You should not need
to start from scratch to do this! This template will get you started with a solid base for your development.

This particular template will get you started to deploy a Django application
on [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python3/building-app/writing-web-service)! 
The template includes:

 - several branded themes to choose from
 - a basic user and registration model
 - a restful API example
 - several database options supported by Django (sqlite, postgres and mysql)
 - examples of testing for your code

## Getting Started

You can jump in to the [documentation](https://rse-ops.github.io/gcp-django-template) to
get started. If you have any requests for features or questions, please don't hesitate
to [open an issue](https://github.com/rse-ops/gcp-django-template/issues).

## Extra Features

The following extra features might be useful to you, and if you would like help to develop
them for your application, please [let us know](https://github.com/rse-ops/gcp-django-template/issues).

 - **Custom Search** of pages or models (the current search goes to Ask.CI search)
 - **Social Authentication** for login with social identities such as Twitter, Google, Globus, etc.
 - **SAML authentication** for more specific access.
 
## Thanks
